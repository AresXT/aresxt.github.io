			<text>Amble magically polymorphs into a beast with a challenge rating of 1 or less, and can remain in this form for up to 6 hours. Amble's equipment melds with their new form.

			<text>  Amble's game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but they retain their alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. Amble also retains all their skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as Amble and the bonus in its stat block is higher, use the creature's bonus instead of Amble's.</text>

However, if Amble reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over their normal form.</text>
			<text>  Amble can't cast spells, and their ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of their beast form. Transforming doesn't break Amble's concentration on a spell they've already cast however, or prevent them from taking actions that are part of a spell.</text>

			<name>Umberlee's Wake (Recharge 5-6)</name>
			<text>Power ripples out in a 60-foot radius sphere from a point within range (150 ft.) as the will of Umberlee affects all in her watery embrace. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature can't use reactions, its speed is halved, and it can't make more than one attack on its turn. In addition, the creature can use either an action or a bonus action on its turn, but not both. These effects last for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself with a successful save. This only affects targets that are submerged or floating in water. Gar Shatterkeel and any undead serving him are immune to this effect.</text>

			<name>Lair Actions</name>
			<text>If Gar is in the water node while Olhydra isn't, he can take lair actions. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Gar uses a lair action to use his Multiattack or cast one of his spells, up to 3rd level, without using components or a spell slot. He can't cast the same spell two rounds in a row, but he can continue to concentrate on a spell he previously cast using a lair action. He can take no other lair actions while concentrating on a spell cast as a lair action. His favorite use of this capability is casting inflict wounds or call lightning.</text>
			<text>If Gar casts cure wounds using this lair action, he regains the maximum number of hit points from the spell (28).</text>

			<name>Lair Actions</name>
			<text>Gar can employ lair actions while he's within the coral mountain.</text>
			<text>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Gar Shatterkeel takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; Gar can't use the same effect two rounds in a row.</text>
			<text>â€¢ Gar may teleport anywhere within the coral mountain, bringing up to five willing creatures with him.</text>
			<text>â€¢ The coral in a 60-foot radius grows rapidly around creatures inside the coral mountain. Each creature must succeed on a DC 18 Strength saving throw or become restrained. Restrained creatures can take an action on their turn to make a DC 18 Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to free themselves. This effect lasts for 1 minute unless dispelled (it counts as a 6th level spell), and doesn't require Gar to maintain concentration. Gar Shatterkeel and any creatures he designates are immune to this effect.</text>
			<text>â€¢ Up to five corpses that Gar can see within 60 feet rise up as drowned blade and attack anyone Gar directs them to on his turn.</text>

			<text>â€¢ A thunderclap originates at a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. Each creature within a 20-foot radius centered on that point must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 5 (1d10) thunder damage and be deafened until the end of its next turn.</text>
		</legendary>
		<legendary>
			<name>Regional Effects</name>
			<text>The region containing a legendary bronze dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic.</text>
			<text>â€¢ Once per day, the dragon can alter the weather in a 6-mile radius centered on its lair. The dragon doesn't need to be outdoors; otherwise the effect is identical to the control weather spell.</text>
			<text>â€¢ Underwater plants within 6 miles of the dragon's lair take on dazzlingly brilliant hues.</text>
			<text>â€¢ Within its lair, the dragon can set illusory sounds, such as soft music and strange echoes, so that they can be heard in various parts of the lair.</text>
			<text>If the dragon dies, changed weather reverts to normal, as described in the spell, and the other effects fade in 1d10 days.</text>
