			<text>    While possessing the corpse, the dybbuk retains its hit points, alignment, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, telepathy, and immunity to poison damage, exhaustion, and being charmed and frightened. It otherwise uses the possessed target's game statistics, gaining access to its knowledge and proficiencies but not its class features, if any.</text>

			<name>Sulfurous Impersonation</name>
			<text>As a bonus action, the oblex can extrude a piece of itself that assumes the appearance of one Medium or smaller creature whose memories it has stolen. This simulacrum appears, feels, and sounds exactly like the creature it impersonates, though it smells faintly of sulfur. The oblex can impersonate 2d6 + 1 different creatures, each one tethered to its body by a strand of slime that can extend up to 120 feet away. For all practical purposes, the simulacrum is the oblex, meaning the oblex occupies its space and the simulacrum's space simultaneously. The slimy tether is immune to damage, but it is severed if there is no opening at least 1 inch wide between the oblex's main body and the simulacrum. The simulacrum disappears if the tether is severed.</text>

		<action>
			<name>Eat Memories</name>
			<text>The oblex targets one creature it can see within 5 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or take 44 (8d10) psychic damage and become memory drained until it finishes a short or long rest or until it benefits from the greater restoration or heal spell. Constructs, oozes, plants, and undead succeed on the save automatically.</text>
			<text>    While memory drained, the target must roll a d4 and subtract the number rolled from any ability check or attack roll it makes. Each time the target is memory drained beyond the first, the die size increases by one: the d4 becomes a d6, the d6 becomes a d8, and so on until the die becomes a d20, at which point the target becomes unconscious for 1 hour. The effect then ends.</text>
			<text>    When an oblex causes a target to become memory drained, the oblex learns all the languages the target knows and gains all its proficiencies, except any saving throw proficiencies.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>Unconscious:</text>

A creature whose space the hellfire engine enters must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw. On a successful save, the creature is pushed to the nearest space out of the hellfire engine’s path. On a failed save, the creature falls prone and takes 28 (8d6) bludgeoning damage.</text>

While restrained in this way, the creature, or another creature within 5 feet of it, can make a DC 18 Strength check. On a success, the creature is shunted to an unoccupied space of its choice within 5 feet of the hellfire engine and is no longer restrained.</text>

			<text>A clockwork doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.</text>
		</trait>
		<trait>
			<name>Magic Resistance</name>
			<text>The iron cobra has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.</text>
		</trait>
		<trait>
			<name>Individual Designs</name>
			<text>A gnome artisan values an individualized clockwork more highly than a perfectly functioning one that copies too much from another creation. For that reason, even clockworks that fit established designs, such as those described here, are seldom identical.</text>
			<text>    A clockwork can be customized by adding one of the following enhancements and one potential malfunction to its stat block. You can select randomly or choose a pair of modifications that fit the temperament of the clockwork's builder.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>d10 — Enhancement:</text>
			<text/>
			<text>1 — Camouflaged. The clockwork gains proficiency in Stealth if it doesn't already have it. While motionless, it is indistinguishable from a stopped machine.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>2 — Sensors. The range of the clockwork's darkvision becomes 120 feet, unless it is higher, and it gains proficiency in Perception if it doesn't already have it.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>3 — Improved Armor. The clockwork's AC increases by 2.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>4 — Increased Speed. The clockwork's speed increases by 10 feet.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>5 — Reinforced Construction. The clockwork has resistance to force, lightning, and thunder damage.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>6 — Self-Repairing. If the clockwork starts its turn with at least 1 hit point, it regains 5 hit points. If it takes lightning damage, this ability doesn't function at the start of its next turn.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>7 — Sturdy Frame. The clockwork's hit point maximum increases by an amount equal to its number of Hit Dice.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>8 — Suction. The clockwork gains a climbing speed of 30 feet.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>9 — Vocal Resonator. The clockwork gains the ability to speak rudimentary Common or Gnomish (creator's choice).</text>
			<text/>
			<text>10 — Water Propulsion. The clockwork gains a swimming speed of 30 feet.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>Clockwork Malfunctions:</text>
			<text/>
			<text>d10 — Malfunction</text>
			<text/>
			<text>1 — Faulty Sensors. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork is blinded until the end of its turn.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>2 — Flawed Targeting. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork makes attack rolls with disadvantage until the end of its turn.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>3 — Ground Fault. The clockwork has vulnerability to lightning damage.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>4 — Imprinting Loop. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork mistakes one creature it can see within 30 feet for its creator. The clockwork won't willingly harm that creature for 1 minute or until that creature attacks it or deals damage to it.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>5 — Leaking Lubricant. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork gains 1 level of exhaustion that it isn't immune to.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>6 — Limited Steering. The clockwork must move in a straight line. It can turn up to 90 degrees before moving and again at the midpoint of its movement. It can rotate freely if it doesn't use any of its speeds on its turn.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>7 — Overactive Sense of Self-Preservation. If the clockwork has half its hit points or fewer at the start of its turn in combat, roll a d6. If you roll a 1, it retreats from combat. If retreat isn't possible, it continues fighting.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>8 — Overheats. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork is incapacitated until the end of its turn.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>9 — Rusty Gears. The clockwork has disadvantage on initiative rolls, and its speed decreases by 10 feet.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>10 — Weak Armor. The clockwork isn't immune to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks that aren't adamantine.</text>
		</trait>
		<action>
			<name>Bite</name>
			<text>Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or suffer one random poison effect:</text>
			<text/>
			<text>1. Poison Damage: The target takes 13 (3d8) poison damage.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>2. Confusion: On its next turn, the target must use its action to make one weapon attack against a random creature it can see within 30 feet of it, using whatever weapon it has in hand and moving beforehand if necessary to get in range. If it's holding no weapon, it makes an unarmed strike. If no creature is visible within 30 feet, it takes the Dash action, moving toward the nearest creature.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>3. Paralysis: The target is paralyzed until the end of its next turn.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>Paralyzed:</text>
			<text>• A paralyzed creature is incapacitated, meaning it can't take actions or reactions, and can't move or speak.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>• The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>• Any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature.</text>

On a failure, the target takes 55 (10d10) acid damage. Unless the target avoids taking any of this damage, any metal armor worn by the target takes a permanent -1 penalty to the AC it offers, and any metal weapon it is carrying or wearing takes a permanent -1 penalty to damage rolls. The penalty worsens each time a target is subjected to this effect. If the penalty on an object drops to -5, the object is destroyed.</text>

			<name>Devour Soul</name>
			<text>A nabassu can eat the soul of a creature it has killed within the last hour, provided that creature is neither a construct nor an undead. The devouring requires the nabassu to be within 5 feet of the corpse for at least 10 minutes, after which it gains a number of Hit Dice (d8s) equal to half the creature's number of Hit Dice. Roll those dice, and increase the nabassu's hit points by the numbers rolled. For every 4 Hit Dice the nabassu gains in this way, its attacks deal an extra 3 (1d6) damage on a hit. The nabassu retains these benefits for 6 days. A creature devoured by a nabassu can be restored to life only by a wish spell.</text>

This reduction lasts until the target finishes a short or long rest. The target dies if its hit point maximum is reduced to 0, and if the target is a humanoid, it immediately rises as a ghoul under the nabassu's control.</text>

			<text>A clockwork doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.</text>

		<trait>
			<name>Magic Resistance</name>
			<text>The oaken bolter has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.</text>
		</trait>
		<trait>
			<name>Individual Designs</name>
			<text>A gnome artisan values an individualized clockwork more highly than a perfectly functioning one that copies too much from another creation. For that reason, even clockworks that fit established designs, such as those described here, are seldom identical.</text>
			<text>    A clockwork can be customized by adding one of the following enhancements and one potential malfunction to its stat block. You can select randomly or choose a pair of modifications that fit the temperament of the clockwork's builder.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>d10 — Enhancement:</text>
			<text/>
			<text>1 — Camouflaged. The clockwork gains proficiency in Stealth if it doesn't already have it. While motionless, it is indistinguishable from a stopped machine.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>2 — Sensors. The range of the clockwork's darkvision becomes 120 feet, unless it is higher, and it gains proficiency in Perception if it doesn't already have it.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>3 — Improved Armor. The clockwork's AC increases by 2.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>4 — Increased Speed. The clockwork's speed increases by 10 feet.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>5 — Reinforced Construction. The clockwork has resistance to force, lightning, and thunder damage.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>6 — Self-Repairing. If the clockwork starts its turn with at least 1 hit point, it regains 5 hit points. If it takes lightning damage, this ability doesn't function at the start of its next turn.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>7 — Sturdy Frame. The clockwork's hit point maximum increases by an amount equal to its number of Hit Dice.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>8 — Suction. The clockwork gains a climbing speed of 30 feet.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>9 — Vocal Resonator. The clockwork gains the ability to speak rudimentary Common or Gnomish (creator's choice).</text>
			<text/>
			<text>10 — Water Propulsion. The clockwork gains a swimming speed of 30 feet.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>Clockwork Malfunctions:</text>
			<text/>
			<text>d10 — Malfunction</text>
			<text/>
			<text>1 — Faulty Sensors. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork is blinded until the end of its turn.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>2 — Flawed Targeting. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork makes attack rolls with disadvantage until the end of its turn.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>3 — Ground Fault. The clockwork has vulnerability to lightning damage.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>4 — Imprinting Loop. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork mistakes one creature it can see within 30 feet for its creator. The clockwork won't willingly harm that creature for 1 minute or until that creature attacks it or deals damage to it.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>5 — Leaking Lubricant. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork gains 1 level of exhaustion that it isn't immune to.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>6 — Limited Steering. The clockwork must move in a straight line. It can turn up to 90 degrees before moving and again at the midpoint of its movement. It can rotate freely if it doesn't use any of its speeds on its turn.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>7 — Overactive Sense of Self-Preservation. If the clockwork has half its hit points or fewer at the start of its turn in combat, roll a d6. If you roll a 1, it retreats from combat. If retreat isn't possible, it continues fighting.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>8 — Overheats. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork is incapacitated until the end of its turn.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>9 — Rusty Gears. The clockwork has disadvantage on initiative rolls, and its speed decreases by 10 feet.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>10 — Weak Armor. The clockwork isn't immune to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks that aren't adamantine.</text>

A creature takes 5 (1d10) slashing damage if it escapes from the grapple or if it tries and fails. As a bonus action, the oaken bolter can pull a creature grappled by it 20 feet closer. The oaken bolter can grapple only one creature at a time.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>Grappled:</text>
			<text>• A grappled creature's speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>• The condition ends if the grappler is incapacitated.</text>

			<text>As a bonus action, the oinoloth blights the area within 30 feet of it. The blight lasts for 24 hours. While blighted, all normal plants in the area wither and die, and the number of hit points restored by a spell to a creature in that area is halved.</text>

On a failed save, the creature's hit point maximum is reduced by 5 (1d10). This reduction lasts until the poison ends, and the target dies if its hit point maximum is reduced to 0.

			<text>The oinoloth touches one willing creature within 5 feet of it. The target regains all its hit points. In addition, the oinoloth can end one disease on the target or remove one of the following conditions from it: blinded, deafened, paralyzed, or poisoned. The target then gains 1 level of exhaustion, and its hit point maximum is reduced by 7 (2d6). This reduction can be removed only by a wish spell or by casting greater restoration on the target three times within the same hour. The target dies if its hit point maximum is reduced to 0.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>Exhaustion:</text>
			<text>    Some special abilities and environmental hazards, such as starvation and the long-term effects of freezing or scorching temperatures, can lead to a special condition called exhaustion. Exhaustion is measured in six levels. An effect can give a creature one or more levels of exhaustion, as specified in the effect's description.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>Level — Effect:</text>
			<text>1 —Disadvantage on ability checks</text>
			<text>2 —Speed halved</text>
			<text>3 —Disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws</text>
			<text>4 —Hit point maximum halved</text>
			<text>5 —Speed reduced to 0</text>
			<text>6 —Death</text>
			<text/>
			<text>If an already exhausted creature suffers another effect that causes exhaustion, its current level of exhaustion increases by the amount specified in the effect's description.</text>
			<text>    A creature suffers the effect of its current level of exhaustion as well as all lower levels. For example, a creature suffering level 2 exhaustion has its speed halved and has disadvantage on ability checks.</text>
			<text>    An effect that removes exhaustion reduces its level as specified in the effect's description, with all exhaustion effects ending if a creature's exhaustion level is reduced below 1.</text>

		<action>
			<name>Warp Creature</name>
			<text>The sibriex targets up to three creatures it can see within 120 feet of it. Each target must make a DC 20 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, a creature becomes immune to this sibriex's Warp Creature. On a failed save, the target is poisoned, which causes it to also gain 1 level of exhaustion. While poisoned in this way, the target must repeat the saving throw at the start of each of its turns. Three successful saves against the poison end it, and ending the poison removes any levels of exhaustion caused by it. Each failed save causes the target to suffer another level of exhaustion. Once the target reaches 6 levels of exhaustion, it dies and instantly transforms into a living abyssal wretch under the sibriex's control. The transformation of the body can be undone only by a wish spell.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>Exhaustion:</text>
			<text>    Some special abilities and environmental hazards, such as starvation and the long-term effects of freezing or scorching temperatures, can lead to a special condition called exhaustion. Exhaustion is measured in six levels. An effect can give a creature one or more levels of exhaustion, as specified in the effect's description.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>Level — Effect:</text>
			<text>1 —Disadvantage on ability checks</text>
			<text>2 —Speed halved</text>
			<text>3 —Disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws</text>
			<text>4 —Hit point maximum halved</text>
			<text>5 —Speed reduced to 0</text>
			<text>6 —Death</text>
			<text/>
			<text>If an already exhausted creature suffers another effect that causes exhaustion, its current level of exhaustion increases by the amount specified in the effect's description.</text>
			<text>    A creature suffers the effect of its current level of exhaustion as well as all lower levels. For example, a creature suffering level 2 exhaustion has its speed halved and has disadvantage on ability checks.</text>
			<text>    An effect that removes exhaustion reduces its level as specified in the effect's description, with all exhaustion effects ending if a creature's exhaustion level is reduced below 1.</text>
			<text>    Finishing a long rest reduces a creature's exhaustion level by 1, provided that the creature has also ingested some food and drink.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>Poisoned:</text>
			<text>• A poisoned creature has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.</text>
		</action>
		<action>
			<name>Variant: Flesh Warping</name>
			<text>Creatures that encounter a sibriex can be twisted beyond recognition. Whenever a creature fails a saving throw against the sibriex's Warp Creature effect, you can roll percentile dice and consult the Flesh Warping table to determine an additional effect, which vanishes when Warp Creature ends on the creature. If the creature transforms into an abyssal wretch, the effect becomes a permanent feature of that body.</text>
			<text>    A creature can willingly submit to flesh warping, an agonizing process that takes at least 1 hour while the creature stays within 30 feet of the sibriex. At the end of the process, roll once on the table (or choose one effect) to determine how the creature is transformed permanently.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>d100 — Effect:</text>
			<text/>
			<text>01–05 — The color of the target's hair, eyes, and skin becomes blue, red, yellow, or patterned.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>06–10 — The target's eyes push out of its head at the end of stalks.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>11–15 — The target's hands grow claws, which can be used as daggers.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>16–20 — One of the target's legs grows longer than the other, reducing its walking speed by 10 feet.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>21–25 — The target's eyes become beacons, filling a 15-foot cone with dim light when they are open.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>26–30 — A pair of wings, either feathered or leathery, sprout from the target's back, granting it a flying speed of 30 feet.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>31–35 — The target's ears tear free from its head and scurry away; the target is deafened.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>36–40 — Two of the target's teeth turn into tusks.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>41–45 — The target's skin becomes scabby, granting it a +1 bonus to AC but reducing its Charisma by 2 (to a minimum of 1).</text>
			<text/>
			<text>46–50 — The target's arms and legs switch places, preventing the target from moving unless it crawls.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>51–55 — The target's arms become tentacles with fingers on the ends, increasing its reach by 5 feet.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>56–60 — The target's legs grow incredibly long and springy, increasing its walking speed by 10 feet.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>61–65 — The target grows a whiplike tail, which it can use as a whip.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>66–70 — The target's eyes turn black, and it gains darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>71–75 — The target swells, tripling its weight.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>76–80 — The target becomes thin and skeletal, halving its weight.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>81–85 — The target's head doubles in size.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>86–90 — The target's ears become wings, giving it a flying speed of 5 feet.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>91–95 — The target's body becomes unusually brittle, causing the target to have vulnerability to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>96–00 — The target grows another head, causing it to have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, frightened, or stunned.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>Deafened:</text>
			<text>• A deafened creature can't hear and automatically fails any ability check that requires hearing. </text>

			<text>A clockwork doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.</text>
		</trait>
		<trait>
			<name>False Appearance</name>
			<text>While the stone defender remains motionless against an uneven earthen or stone surface, it is indistinguishable from that surface.</text>

			<name>Magic Resistance</name>
			<text>The stone defender has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.</text>
		</trait>
		<trait>
			<name>Individual Designs</name>
			<text>A gnome artisan values an individualized clockwork more highly than a perfectly functioning one that copies too much from another creation. For that reason, even clockworks that fit established designs, such as those described here, are seldom identical.</text>
			<text>    A clockwork can be customized by adding one of the following enhancements and one potential malfunction to its stat block. You can select randomly or choose a pair of modifications that fit the temperament of the clockwork's builder.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>d10 — Enhancement:</text>
			<text/>
			<text>1 — Camouflaged. The clockwork gains proficiency in Stealth if it doesn't already have it. While motionless, it is indistinguishable from a stopped machine.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>2 — Sensors. The range of the clockwork's darkvision becomes 120 feet, unless it is higher, and it gains proficiency in Perception if it doesn't already have it.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>3 — Improved Armor. The clockwork's AC increases by 2.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>4 — Increased Speed. The clockwork's speed increases by 10 feet.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>5 — Reinforced Construction. The clockwork has resistance to force, lightning, and thunder damage.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>6 — Self-Repairing. If the clockwork starts its turn with at least 1 hit point, it regains 5 hit points. If it takes lightning damage, this ability doesn't function at the start of its next turn.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>7 — Sturdy Frame. The clockwork's hit point maximum increases by an amount equal to its number of Hit Dice.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>8 — Suction. The clockwork gains a climbing speed of 30 feet.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>9 — Vocal Resonator. The clockwork gains the ability to speak rudimentary Common or Gnomish (creator's choice).</text>
			<text/>
			<text>10 — Water Propulsion. The clockwork gains a swimming speed of 30 feet.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>Clockwork Malfunctions:</text>
			<text/>
			<text>d10 — Malfunction</text>
			<text/>
			<text>1 — Faulty Sensors. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork is blinded until the end of its turn.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>2 — Flawed Targeting. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork makes attack rolls with disadvantage until the end of its turn.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>3 — Ground Fault. The clockwork has vulnerability to lightning damage.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>4 — Imprinting Loop. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork mistakes one creature it can see within 30 feet for its creator. The clockwork won't willingly harm that creature for 1 minute or until that creature attacks it or deals damage to it.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>5 — Leaking Lubricant. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork gains 1 level of exhaustion that it isn't immune to.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>6 — Limited Steering. The clockwork must move in a straight line. It can turn up to 90 degrees before moving and again at the midpoint of its movement. It can rotate freely if it doesn't use any of its speeds on its turn.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>7 — Overactive Sense of Self-Preservation. If the clockwork has half its hit points or fewer at the start of its turn in combat, roll a d6. If you roll a 1, it retreats from combat. If retreat isn't possible, it continues fighting.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>8 — Overheats. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork is incapacitated until the end of its turn.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>9 — Rusty Gears. The clockwork has disadvantage on initiative rolls, and its speed decreases by 10 feet.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>10 — Weak Armor. The clockwork isn't immune to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks that aren't adamantine.</text>

If a creature is near a structure that collapses, the creature might be buried; a creature within half the distance of the structure's height must make a DC 25 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 17 (5d6) bludgeoning damage, is knocked prone, and is trapped in the rubble. A trapped creature is restrained, requiring a successful DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check as an action to escape. Another creature within 5 feet of the buried creature can use its action to clear rubble and grant advantage on the check. If three creatures use their actions in this way, the check is an automatic success. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and doesn't fall prone or become trapped.</text>

			<text>• An attack roll against the creature has advantage if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature. Otherwise, the attack roll has disadvantage.</text>

			<name>Innate Spellcasting</name>
			<text>The hag’s innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 13). She can innately cast the following spells:</text>
			<text/>
			<text>3/day each: disguise self (including the form of a Medium humanoid), fog cloud</text>
		</trait>
		<trait>
			<name>Hag Coven</name>
			<text>When hags must work together, they form covens, in spite of their selfish natures. A coven is made up of hags of any type, all of whom are equals within the group. However, each of the hags continues to desire more personal power.</text>
			<text>    A coven consists of three hags so that any arguments between two hags can be settled by the third. If more than three hags ever come together, as might happen if two covens come into conflict, the result is usually chaos.</text>
		</trait>
		<trait>
			<name>Shared Spellcasting (Coven Only)</name>
			<text>While all three members of a hag coven are within 30 feet of one another, they can each cast the following spells from the wizard's spell list but must share the spell slots among themselves: </text>
			<text/>
			<text>• 1st level (4 slots): identify, ray of sickness </text>
			<text/>
			<text>• 2nd level (3 slots): hold person, locate object </text>
			<text/>
			<text>• 3rd level (3 slots): bestow curse, counterspell, lightning bolt </text>
			<text/>
			<text>• 4th level (3 slots): phantasmal killer, polymorph </text>
			<text/>
			<text>• 5th level (2 slots): contact other plane, scrying </text>
			<text/>
			<text>• 6th level (1 slot): eyebite</text>
			<text/>
			<text>    For casting these spells, each hag is a 12th-level spellcaster that uses Intelligence as her spellcasting ability. The spell save DC is 12+the hag's Intelligence modifier, and the spell attack bonus is 4+the hag's Intelligence modifier.</text>
		</trait>
		<trait>
			<name>Hag Eye (Coven Only)</name>
			<text>A hag coven can craft a magic item called a hag eye, which is made from a real eye coated in varnish and often fitted to a pendant or other wearable item. The hag eye is usually entrusted to a minion for safekeeping and transport. A hag in the coven can take an action to see what the hag eye sees if the hag eye is on the same plane of existence. A hag eye has AC 10, 1 hit point, and darkvision with a radius of 60 feet. If it is destroyed, each coven member takes 3d10 psychic damage and is blinded for 24 hours.</text>
			<text>    A hag coven can have only one hag eye at a time, and creating a new one requires all three members of the coven to perform a ritual. The ritual takes 1 hour, and the hags can't perform it while blinded. During the ritual, if the hags take any action other than performing the ritual, they must start over.</text>

Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the balhannoth can't use this tentacle against other targets. The balhannoth has four tentacles.</text>

			<name>Lair Actions</name>
			<text>When fighting inside its lair, a balhannoth can use lair actions. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), a balhannoth can take one lair action to cause one of the following effects; the balhannoth can't use the same lair action two rounds in a row:</text>
			<text/>
			<text>• The balhannoth warps reality around it in an area up to 500 feet square. After 10 minutes, the terrain in the area reshapes to assume the appearance of a location sought by one intelligent creature whose mind the balhannoth has read (see Regional Effects below). The transformation affects nonliving material only and can't create anything with moving parts or magical properties. Any object created in this area is, upon close inspection, revealed as a fake. Books are filled with empty pages, golden items are obvious counterfeits, and so on. The transformation lasts until the balhannoth dies or uses this lair action again.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>• The balhannoth targets one creature within 500 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or the target, along with whatever it is wearing and carrying, teleports to an unoccupied space of the balhannoth's choice within 60 feet of it.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>• The balhannoth targets one creature within 500 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or the balhannoth becomes invisible to that creature for 1 minute. This effect ends if the balhannoth attacks the target.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>Invisible:</text>
			<text>• An invisible creature is impossible to see without the aid of magic or a special sense. For the purpose of hiding, the creature is heavily obscured. The creature's location can be detected by any noise it makes or any tracks it leaves.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>• Attack rolls against the creature have disadvantage, and the creature's attack rolls have advantage.</text>

			<name>Soul Feeding</name>
			<text>A barghest can feed on the corpse of a humanoid that it killed that has been dead for less than 10 minutes, devouring both flesh and soul in doing so.

If the barghest dies before the soul is digested, the soul is released.</text>
			<text>    While a humanoid's soul is trapped in a barghest, any form of revival that could work has only a 50 percent chance of doing so, freeing the soul from the barghest if it is successful. Once a creature's soul is digested, however, no mortal magic can return that humanoid to life.</text>

			<text>    A coven consists of three hags so that any arguments between two hags can be settled by the third. If more than three hags ever come together, as might happen if two covens come into conflict, the result is usually chaos.</text>

			<text>    For casting these spells, each hag is a 12th-level spellcaster that uses Intelligence as her spellcasting ability. The spell save DC is 12+the hag's Intelligence modifier, and the spell attack bonus is 4+the hag's Intelligence modifier.</text>

		<trait>
			<name>Hag Eye (Coven Only)</name>
			<text>A hag coven can craft a magic item called a hag eye, which is made from a real eye coated in varnish and often fitted to a pendant or other wearable item. The hag eye is usually entrusted to a minion for safekeeping and transport. A hag in the coven can take an action to see what the hag eye sees if the hag eye is on the same plane of existence. A hag eye has AC 10, 1 hit point, and darkvision with a radius of 60 feet. If it is destroyed, each coven member takes 3d10 psychic damage and is blinded for 24 hours.</text>
			<text>    A hag coven can have only one hag eye at a time, and creating a new one requires all three members of the coven to perform a ritual. The ritual takes 1 hour, and the hags can't perform it while blinded. During the ritual, if the hags take any action other than performing the ritual, they must start over.</text>

			<text>The cave fisher can use its action to extend a sticky filament up to 60 feet, and the filament adheres to anything that touches it. A creature adhered to the filament is grappled by the cave fisher (escape DC 13), and ability checks made to escape this grapple have disadvantage. The filament can be attacked (AC 15; 5 hit points; immunity to poison and psychic damage), but a weapon that fails to sever it becomes stuck to it, requiring an action and a successful DC 13 Strength check to pull free. Destroying the filament causes no damage to the cave fisher, which can extrude a replacement filament on its next turn</text>

			<text>Grappled:</text>

			<text>The snail has advantage on saving throws against spells, and any creature making a spell attack against the snail has disadvantage on the attack roll.

Hit: 1 piercing damage, and the target must make a DC 9 Constitution saving throw, taking 4 (1d8) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>7. Skunk in a Cage. The kobold releases a skunk into an unoccupied space within 5 feet of it. The skunk has a walking speed of 20 feet, AC 10, 1 hit point, and no effective attacks. It rolls initiative and, on its turn, uses its action to spray musk at a random creature within 5 feet of it. The target must make a DC 9 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target retches and can’t take actions for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. A creature that doesn’t need to breathe or is immune to poison automatically succeeds on the saving throw. Once the skunk has sprayed its musk, it can’t do so again until it finishes a short or long rest.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>8. Wasp Nest in a Bag. The kobold throws a small bag into a 5-foot-square space within 20 feet of it. A swarm of insects (wasps) with 11 hit points emerges from the bag and rolls initiative. At the end of each of the swarm's turns, there’s a 50 percent chance that the swarm disperses.</text>

If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 18 Strength saving throw or be swallowed by the neothelid. A swallowed creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the neothelid, and it takes 35 (10d6) acid damage at the start of each of the neothelid’s turns.</text>

			<name>Burrowing Worm</name>
			<text>A worm launches from the spawn of Kyuss at one humanoid that the spawn can see within 10 feet of it. The worm latches onto the target’s skin unless the target succeeds on a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw. The worm is a Tiny undead with AC 6, 1 hit point, a 2 (-4) in every ability score, and a speed of 1 foot. While on the target’s skin, the worm can be killed by normal means or scraped off using an action (the spawn can use this action to launch a scraped-off worm at a humanoid it can see within 10 feet of the worm). Otherwise, the worm burrows under the target’s skin at the end of the target's next turn, dealing l piercing damage to it. At the end of each of its turns thereafter, the target takes 7 (2d6) necrotic damage per worm infesting it (maximum of 10d6). A worm-infested target dies if it drops to 0 hit points, then rises 10 minutes later as a spawn of Kyuss. If a worm-infested creature is targeted by an effect that cures disease or removes a curse, all the worms infesting it wither away.</text>

			<text>An enemy that starts its turn within 30 feet of the giant must make a DC 13 Charisma saving throw, provided that the giant isn’t incapacitated.

			<name>Petrifying Touch</name>
			<text>The giant touches one Medium or smaller creature within 10 feet of it that is charmed by it. The target must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target becomes petrified, and the giant can adhere the target to its stony body. Greater restoration spells and other magic that can undo petrification have no effect on a petrified creature on the giant unless the giant is dead, in which case the magic works normally, freeing the petrified creature as well as ending the petrified condition on it.</text>

The hound is visible on the Material Plane while it is in the Border Ethereal, and vice versa, but it can’t affect or be affected by anything on the other plane.

The yuan-ti must concentrate to maintain the illusion (as if concentrating on a spell), which lasts for up to 1 minute and can’t be harmed.

The felidar can sense the direction and distance to the bonded creature if they're on the same plane of existence. As an action, the felidar or the bonded creature can sense what the other sees and hears, during which time it loses its own sight and hearing.
