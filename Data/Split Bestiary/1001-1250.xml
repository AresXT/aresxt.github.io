			<name>Entrapping Pod</name>
			<text>Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one Medium or smaller creature grappled by the plant. Hit: 22 (4d8 + 4) acid damage, and the target is pulled into the plant's space and enveloped by the pod, and the grapple ends. While enveloped, the target is restrained, and it has total cover against attacks and effects originating outside the pod. The enveloped target must also immediately succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be stunned by the plant's sapping enzymes until it is removed from the pod or the plant dies. The enveloped target doesn't require air and gains 1 level of exhaustion for each hour it spends in the pod. If the target dies while enveloped, it immediately emerges from the pod as a living podling, wearing or carrying all of the original creature's equipment. As an action, a creature within 5 feet of the bodytaker plant that is outside the pod can open the pod and pull the target free with a successful DC 15 Strength check. If the plant dies, the target is no longer restrained and can escape from the pod by spending 10 feet of movement, exiting prone. The plant has one pod, which can envelop one creature at a time.</text>

			<text>On its turn, the driver of the Devil's Ride can expend 10 feet of movement to perform one free infernal vehicle stunt, such as a wheelie or a burnout. Before the stunt can be performed, the Devil's Ride must move at least 10 feet in a straight line. If the driver succeeds on DC 10 Dexterity check using the bike's Dexterity, the stunt is successful. Otherwise, the driver is unable to perform the stunt and can't attempt another stunt until the start of its next turn. If the check fails by 5 or more, the Devil's Ride and all creatures riding it immediately fall prone as the bike wipes out and comes to a dead stop.</text>

			<name>Berserk</name>
			<text>Whenever the golem starts its turn with 100 hit points or fewer, roll a d6. On a 6, the golem goes berserk. On each of its turns while berserk, the golem attacks the nearest creature it can see. If no creature is near enough to move to and attack, the golem attacks an object, with preference for an object smaller than itself. Once the golem goes berserk, it continues to do so until it is destroyed or regains all its hit points. If the golem's creator is within 60 feet of the berserk golem, the creator can try to calm it by speaking firmly and persuasively. The golem must be able to hear its creator, who must take an action to make a DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check. If the check succeeds, the golem ceases being berserk. If it takes damage while still at 100 hit points or fewer, the golem might go berserk again.</text>

			<name>Lair Actions</name>
			<text>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Burney takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects:</text>
			<text>• Burney chooses a point on the ground that it can see within 120 feet of it. Stone spikes sprout from the ground in a 20-foot radius centered on that point. The effect is otherwise identical to the spike growth spell and lasts until the dragon uses this lair action again or until the dragon dies.</text>
			<text>• Burney chooses a 10-foot-square area on the ground that it can see within 120 feet of it. The ground in that area turns into 3-foot-deep mud. Each creature on the ground in that area when the mud appears must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or sink into the mud and become restrained. A creature can take an action to attempt a DC 15 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach and ending the restrained condition on a success. Moving 1 foot in the mud costs 2 feet of movement. On initiative count 20 on the next round, the mud hardens, and the Strength DC to work free increases to 20.</text>

			<name>Regional Effects</name>
			<text>The region containing a legendary copper dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:</text>
			<text>• Magic carvings of the dragon's smiling visage can be seen worked into stone terrain and objects within 6 miles of the dragon's lair.</text>
			<text>• Tiny beasts such as rodents and birds that are normally unable to speak gain the magical ability to speak and understand Draconic while within 1 mile of the dragon's lair. These creatures speak well of the dragon, but can't divulge its whereabouts.</text>
			<text>• Intelligent creatures within 1 mile of the dragon's lair are prone to fits of giggling. Even serious matters suddenly seem amusing.</text>
			<text>If the dragon dies, the magic carvings fade over the course of 1d10 days. The other effects end immediately.</text>

			<text>An invisible aura forms a 10-foot-radius sphere around Lulu for as long as it lives. Any spell of 5th level or lower cast from outside the barrier can't affect creatures or objects within it, even if the spell is cast using a higher level spell slot. Such a spell can target creatures and objects within the barrier, but the spell has no effect on them. Similarly, the area within the barrier is excluded from the areas affected by such spells. Lulu can use an action to suppress this trait until its concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell).</text>

		<trait>
			<name>Innate Spellcasting</name>
			<text>Maggie's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 14, +6 to hit with spell attacks). She can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:</text>
			<text/>
			<text>At will: detect magic, magic missile</text>
			<text>2/day each: plane shift (self only), ray of enfeeblement, sleep</text>
		</trait>
		<trait>
			<name>Shared Spellcasting (Coven Only)</name>
			<text>While all three members of a hag coven are within 30 feet of one another, they can each cast the following spells from the wizard's spell list but must share the spell slots among themselves:</text>
			<text/>
			<text>• 1st level (4 slots): identify, ray of sickness</text>
			<text>• 2nd level (3 slots): hold person, locate object</text>
			<text>• 3rd level (3 slots): bestow curse, counterspell, lightning bolt</text>
			<text>• 4th level (3 slots): phantasmal killer, polymorph</text>
			<text>• 5th level (2 slots): contact other plane, scrying</text>
			<text>• 6th level (1 slots): eyebite</text>
			<text/>
			<text>For casting these spells, each hag is a 12th-level spellcaster that uses Intelligence as her spellcasting ability. The spell save DC is 12 + Maggie's Intelligence modifier, and the spell attack bonus is 4 + Maggie's Intelligence modifier.</text>
		</trait>
		<trait>
			<name>Night Hag Items</name>
			<text>A night hag carries two very rare magic items that she must craft for herself. If either object is lost, the night hag will go to great lengths to retrieve it, as creating a new tool takes time and effort.</text>
			<text>Heartstone: This lustrous black gem allows a night hag to become ethereal while it is in her possession. The touch of a heartstone also cures any disease. Crafting a heartstone takes 30 days.</text>
			<text>Soul Bag (contains nine soul coins): When an evil humanoid dies as a result of a night hag's Nightmare Haunting, Maggie catches the soul in this black sack made of stitched flesh. A soul bag can hold only one evil soul at a time, and only the night hag who crafted the bag can catch a soul with it. Crafting a soul bag takes 7 days and a humanoid sacrifice (whose flesh is used to make the bag).</text>
		</trait>
		<trait>
			<name>Hag Coven</name>
			<text>When hags must work together, they form covens, in spite of their selfish natures. A coven is made up of hags of any type, all of whom are equals within the group. However, each of Maggies continues to desire more personal power.</text>
			<text>A coven consists of three hags so that any arguments between two hags can be settled by the third. If more than three hags ever come together, as might happen if two covens come into conflict, the result is usually chaos.</text>
		</trait>
		<trait>
			<name>Hag Eye (Coven Only)</name>
			<text>A hag coven can craft a magic item called a hag eye, which is made from a real eye coated in varnish and often fitted to a pendant or other wearable item. Maggie eye is usually entrusted to a minion for safekeeping and transport. A hag in the coven can take an action to see what Maggie eye sees if Maggie eye is on the same plane of existence. A hag eye has AC 10, 1 hit point, and darkvision with a radius of 60 feet. If it is destroyed, each coven member takes 3d10 psychic damage and is blinded for 24 hours.</text>
			<text>A hag coven can have only one hag eye at a time, and creating a new one requires all three members of the coven to perform a ritual. The ritual takes 1 hour, and Maggies can't perform it while blinded. During the ritual, if Maggies take any action other than performing the ritual, they must start over.</text>

			<name>Nightmare Haunting (1/Day)</name>
			<text>While on the Ethereal Plane, Maggie magically touches a sleeping humanoid on the Material Plane. A protection from evil and good spell cast on the target prevents this contact, as does a magic circle. As long as the contact persists, the target has dreadful visions. If these visions last for at least 1 hour, the target gains no benefit from its rest, and its hit point maximum is reduced by 5 (1d10). If this effect reduces the target's hit point maximum to 0, the target dies, and if the target was evil, its soul is trapped in Maggie's soul bag. The reduction to the target's hit point maximum lasts until removed by the  greater restoration spell or similar magic.</text>

			<name>Shapechanger</name>
			<text>If Strahd isn't in running water or sunlight, he can use his action to polymorph into a Tiny bat, a Medium wolf, or a Medium cloud of mist, or back into his true form.</text>
			<text>	While in bat or wolf form, Strahd can't speak. In bat form, his walking speed is 5 feet, and he has a flying speed of 30 feet. In wolf form, his walking speed is 40 feet. His statistics, other than his size and speed, are unchanged. Anything he is wearing transforms with him, but nothing he is carrying does. He reverts to his true form if he dies.</text>
			<text>	While in mist form, Strahd can't take any actions, speak, or manipulate objects. He is weightless, has a flying speed of 30 feet, can hover, and can enter a hostile creature's space and stop there. In addition, if air can pass through a space, the mist can do so without squeezing, and he can't pass through water. He has advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws, and it is immune to all nonmagical damage, except the damage he takes from sunlight.</text>

			<text>	While he has 0 hit points in mist form, he can't revert to his vampire form, and he must reach his coffin within 2 hours or be destroyed. Once in his coffin, he reverts to his vampire form. He is then paralyzed until he regains at least 1 hit point. After spending 1 hour in his coffin with 0 hit points, he regains 1 hit point.</text>

			<text>	Forbiddance: He can't enter a residence without an invitation from one of the occupants.</text>
			<text>	Harmed by Running Water: He takes 20 acid damage if he ends his turn in running water.</text>
			<text>	Stake to the Heart: If a piercing weapon made of wood is driven into his heart while he is incapacitated in his coffin, he is paralyzed until the stake is removed.</text>

		<action>
			<name>Bite</name>
			<text>Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one willing creature, or a creature that is grappled by Strahd, incapacitated, or restrained. Hit: 7 (1d6+4) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) necrotic damage. The target's hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken, and Strahd regains hit points equal to that amount. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if  its hit point maximum is reduced to 0. A humanoid slain in this way and then buried in the ground rises the following night as a vampire spawn under Strahd's control.</text>

			<name>Charm</name>
			<text>Strahd targets one humanoid he can see within 30 ft. of him. If the target can see Strahd, the target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw against this magic or be charmed. The charmed target regards Strahd as a trusted friend to be heeded and protected. The target isn't under Strahd's control, but it takes Strahd's requests and actions in the most favorable way and lets Strahd bite it.</text>
			<text>	Each time Strahd or his companions do anything harmful to the target, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. Otherwise, the effect lasts 24 hours or until Strahd is destroyed, is on a different plane of existence than the target, or takes a bonus action to end the effect.</text>
		</action>

			<name>Children of the Night (1/day)</name>
			<text>Strahd magically calls 2d4 swarms of bats or swarms rats, provided that the sun isn't up. While outdoors, Strahd can call 3d6 wolves instead.

On a failure, the target is paralyzed until Vladimir deals damage to it, or until the end of Vladimir's next turn. When the paralysis ends, the target is frightened of Vladimir for 1 minute. The frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, with disadvantage if it can see Vladimir, ending the frightened condition on itself on a success.</text>

The disease is carried by undead (including the drowned ones in Tammeraut’s Fate), and victims most often acquire it through wounds caused by infected creatures.
		The disease’s boils manifests in 1d4 hours, causing the victim’s Constitution and Charisma scores to decrease by 1d4 each, to a minimum of 3. This is quickly followed by a fever and tingling in the extremities.  An infected creature is vulnerable to radiant damage and gains the ability to breathe underwater.
		At the end of each long rest, an infected creature makes a DC12 Constitution saving throw.  On a success, the victim regains 1 point of Constitution and 1 point of Charisma lost to the disease.  If the infected creature regains all the points lost to the disease, it is cured.  Other effects that raise the victim’s ability scores do not cure the disease.  On a failed saving throw the victim takes 18 (4d8) necrotic damage as the boils burst and spread. A creature reduced to 0 hit points by this damage cannot regain hit points until the disease is cured, though it can be stabilized as normal.</text>

Each creature caught in the ink must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 27 (6d8) necrotic damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that fails this saving throw is blinded until the end of its next turn and contracts bluerot (see the &quot;Bluerot&quot; sidebar).</text>
			<text>Bluerot: This disease targets humanoids. While afflicted with bluerot, a victim grows grotesque blue boils on their face and back.  The disease is carried by undead (including the drowned ones in Tammeraut’s Fate), and victims most often acquire it through wounds caused by infected creatures.
		The disease’s boils manifests in 1d4 hours, causing the victim’s Constitution and Charisma scores to decrease by 1d4 each, to a minimum of 3. This is quickly followed by a fever and tingling in the extremities.  An infected creature is vulnerable to radiant damage and gains the ability to breathe underwater.
		At the end of each long rest, an infected creature makes a DC12 Constitution saving throw.  On a success, the victim regains 1 point of Constitution and 1 point of Charisma lost to the disease.  If the infected creature regains all the points lost to the disease, it is cured.  Other effects that raise the victim’s ability scores do not cure the disease.  On a failed saving throw the victim takes 18 (4d8) necrotic damage as the boils burst and spread. A creature reduced to 0 hit points by this damage cannot regain hit points until the disease is cured, though it can be stabilized as normal.</text>

			<text>The wave shaper targets a body of water at least 50 feet square and 25 feet deep, causing a whirlpool to form in the center of the area.

Any creature or object in the water and within 25 feet of the vortex is pulled 10 feet toward it. A creature can swim away from the vortex by succeeding on a DC 14 Strength (Athletics) check.</text>
			<text>When a creature enters the vortex for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a DC 14 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 9 (2d8) bludgeoning damage and is caught in the vortex until it ends. On a success, the creature takes half damage and isn't caught in the vortex. A creature caught in the vortex can use its action to try to swim away from the vortex as described above, but it has disadvantage on the Strength (Athletics) check to do so.</text>
			<text>The first time each turn that an object enters the vortex, the object takes 9 (2d8) bludgeoning damage. This damage occurs each round it remains in the vortex.</text>

Any flesh-and-blood creature in the cloud when it appears, or that enters it later, must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, the creature can't be infected by these spores for 24 hours. On a failed save, the creature is infected with a disease called the spores of Zuggtmoy and also gains a random form of indefinite madness (determined by rolling on the Madness of Zuggtmoy table in appendix D) that lasts until the creature is cured of the disease or dies. While infected in this way, the creature can't be reinfected, and it must be repeat the saving throw at the end of every 24 hours, ending the infection on a success. On a failure, the infected creature's body is slowly taken over by fungal growth, and after three such failed saves, the creature dies and is reanimated as a spore servant if it's a type of creature that can be (see the &quot;Myconids&quot; entry in the Monster Manual).</text>

			<text>Imix creates a blast of heat within 300 feet of himself. Each creature in the area in physical contact with metal objects (for example, carrying metal weapons or wearing metal armor) takes 9 (2d8) fire damage. Each creature in the area that isn't resistant or immune to fire damage must make a DC 21 Constitution saving throw or gain one level of exhaustion.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>Exhaustion:</text>
			<text>	Some special abilities and environmental hazards, such as starvation and the long-term effects of freezing or scorching temperatures, can lead to a special condition called exhaustion. Exhaustion is measured in six levels. An effect can give a creature one or more levels of exhaustion, as specified in the effect's description.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>Level — Effect:</text>
			<text>1 —Disadvantage on ability checks</text>
			<text>2 —Speed halved</text>
			<text>3 —Disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws</text>
			<text>4 —Hit point maximum halved</text>
			<text>5 —Speed reduced to 0</text>
			<text>6 —Death</text>
			<text/>
			<text>If an already exhausted creature suffers another effect that causes exhaustion, its current level of exhaustion increases by the amount specified in the effect's description.</text>
			<text>	A creature suffers the effect of its current level of exhaustion as well as all lower levels. For example, a creature suffering level 2 exhaustion has its speed halved and has disadvantage on ability checks.</text>
			<text>	An effect that removes exhaustion reduces its level as specified in the effect's description, with all exhaustion effects ending if a creature's exhaustion level is reduced below 1.</text>

			<text>Imix causes one creature he can see within 30 feet of him to burst into flames. The target must make a DC 21 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 70 (20d6) fire damage and catches fire.

On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage and doesn't catch fire.</text>

If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature is instantly petrified. Otherwise, a creature that fails the save begins to turn to stone and is restrained. The restrained creature must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn, becoming petrified on a failure or ending the effect on a success. The petrification lasts until the creature is freed by the greater restoration spell or other magic.</text>
			<text>	Unless surprised, a creature can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If the creature does so, it can't see Marlos until the start of its next turn, when it can decide to avert its eyes again. If the creature looks at Marlos in the meantime, it must immediately make the save.</text>
