			<text>Belashyrra rips at the bonds of reality in its immediate area. Each creature within 10 feet of Belashyrra must succeed on a DC 22 Constitution saving throw or take 19 (3d12) force damage and gain one level of exhaustion.</text>
		</legendary>
		<legendary>
			<name>Lair Actions</name>
			<text>While within the Citadel of Lidless Eyes, Belashyrra can invoke the ambient magic to take lair actions. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Belashyrra can take a lair action to cause one of the following effects; it can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:</text>
			<text>• An eye opens on a solid surface within 60 feet of Belashyrra. One random eye ray of Belashyrra's shoots from that eye at a target of Belashyrra's choice that it can see. The eye then closes and disappears.</text>
			<text>• Belashyrra creates a wave of madness. Each creature it can see within its lair must succeed on a DC 22 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed for 1 minute. While charmed in this way, a creature must use its action at the start of its turn before moving to make a melee attack against another creature of Belashyrra's choice within reach. If there are no creatures within reach, the charmed creature can act normally for that turn. A charmed creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</text>
			<text>• Belashyrra taps into the eyesight of creatures in its lair and alters their perception. Each creature of Belashyrra's choice in the lair must make a DC 22 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the affected creature perceives objects and creatures a short distance from their actual locations, imposing disadvantage on the creature's attack rolls against those targets. An affected creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to this lair action for the next 24 hours.</text>
		</legendary>
		<legendary>
			<name>Regional Effects</name>
			<text>Belashyrra's lair is known to touch remote areas of the Shadow Marches and caverns below Xen'drik. A region containing a passage to Belashyrra's lair is warped by its magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:</text>
			<text>• Creatures within 1 mile of the passage sometimes feel as if they're being watched.</text>
			<text>• Beasts that live within 5 miles of the passage undergo magical transmutation, growing eyes or eyestalks that Belashyrra can see through.</text>
			<text>• A humanoid who spends at least 1 hour within 1 mile of the passage must succeed on a DC 21 Wisdom saving throw or descend into a type of madness (see &quot;Madness of Belashyrra&quot; below). A creature that succeeds on this saving throw can't be affected by this regional effect again for 24 hours.</text>
			<text>If Belashyrra dies, these effects fade over the course of 1d10 days.</text>

			<text>• A 30-foot-square area of ground within 120 feet of Dyrrn sprouts tentacles until initiative count 20 on the next round. Any creature that starts or ends its turn in the area must succeed on a DC 23 Strength saving throw or be restrained. A creature can escape the tentacles with a successful DC 23 Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check as an action.</text>
			<text>• Each creature of Dyrrn's choice that it can see within 120 feet of it must succeed on a DC 23 Wisdom saving throw or take 26 (4d12) psychic damage. Unless the target has immunity to psychic damage, its Intelligence score is reduced by 1d4 each time it fails the saving throw for this lair action. The target dies if its Intelligence score is reduced to 0. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a short or long rest.</text>
		</legendary>
		<legendary>
			<name>Regional Effects</name>
			<text>A region containing a passage to Dyrrn's lair is warped in one or more of these ways:</text>
			<text>• Plants and animals raised within 2 mile of the passage have twisted, aberrant forms. Use the Daelkyr Modifications table for inspiration.</text>
			<text>• Creatures within 1 mile of the passage frequently feel as if something is crawling under their skin.</text>
			<text>• If a humanoid spends at least 1 hour within 1 mile of the passage, that creature must succeed on a DC 22 Wisdom saving throw or descend into a type of madness (see &quot;Madness of Dyrrn&quot; below). A creature that succeeds on this saving throw can't be affected by this regional effect again for 24 hours.</text>
			<text>If Dyrrn dies, these effects fade away after 1d10 days.</text>

			<text>• A cloud of swarming insects fills a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point Oracs chooses within 120 feet of it. The cloud spreads around corners and remains until Oracs dismisses it as an action, uses this lair action again, or dies. The cloud is lightly obscured. Any creature in the cloud when it appears must make on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that ends its turn in the cloud takes 10 (3d6) piercing damage.</text>
			<text>• Magical darkness spreads from a point Oracs chooses within 60 feet of it, filling a 15-foot-radius sphere until Oracs dismisses it as an action, uses this lair action again, or dies. The darkness spreads around corners. A creature with darkvision can't see through this darkness, and nonmagical light can't illuminate it. If any of the effect's area overlaps with an area of light created by a spell of 2nd level or lower, the spell that created the light is dispelled.</text>

			<text>• The land within 6 miles of the lair takes twice as long as normal to traverse, since the plants grow thick and twisted, and the swamps are thick with reeking mud.</text>
			<text>• Water sources within 1 mile of the lair are supernaturally fouled. Enemies of Oracs that drink such water regurgitate it within minutes.</text>
			<text>• Fog lightly obscures the land within 6 miles of the lair.</text>

			<text>Eye of FearThe target and up to four other creatures of the eye of fear and flame's choice within 10 feet of the target must each succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. An affected creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</text>
			<text>	Eye of FlameThe target must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 44 (8d10) fire damage, and if it is a creature or a flammable object, it ignites. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage and does not ignite. A target that ignites takes 5 (1d10) fire damage at the start of each of its turns until a creature takes an action to douse the fire.</text>

			<name>Petrifying Gaze</name>
			<text>When a creature that can see Hythonia's eyes starts its turn within 30 feet of her, Hythonia can force it to make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw if she isn't incapacitated and can see the creature. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature is instantly petrified. Otherwise, on a failed save the creature begins to turn to stone and is restrained. The restrained creature must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn, becoming petrified on a failure or ending the effect on a success. The petrification lasts until the creature is freed by the greater restoration spell or other magic. Unless surprised, a creature can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If the creature does so, it can't see Hythonia until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If the creature looks at Hythonia in the meantime, it must immediately make the save. If Hythonia sees herself reflected on a polished surface within 30 feet of her and in an area of bright light, she is affected by her own gaze.</text>

			<text>The cerberus exhales a 30-foot cone of molten rock. Each creature in the cone must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 21 (6d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. On a failed save, a creature is also restrained by the hardening rock. A creature can make a DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check as an action, freeing itself or a creature within reach from the rock on a success. The rock has AC 17 and 20 hit points, and it is immune to fire, poison, and psychic damage.</text>
