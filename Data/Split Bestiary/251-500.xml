If the target is a Large or smaller creature grappled by the kraken, that creature is swallowed, and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the kraken, and it takes 42 (12d6) acid damage at the start of each of the kraken's turns. If the kraken takes 50 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the kraken must succeed on a DC 25 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall prone in a space within 10 feet of the kraken. If the kraken dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse using 15 feet of movement, exiting prone.</text>

			<text>While underwater, the kraken expels an ink cloud in a 60-foot radius. The cloud spreads around corners, and that area is heavily obscured to creatures other than the kraken. Each creature other than the kraken that ends its turn there must succeed on a DC 23 Constitution saving throw, taking 16 (3d10) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A strong current disperses the cloud, which otherwise disappears at the end of the kraken's next turn.</text>

			<name>Variant: Genie Powers</name>
			<text>Genies have a variety of magical capabilities, including spells. A few have even greater powers that allow them to alter their appearance or the nature of reality.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>	Disguises.</text>
			<text>	Some genies can veil themselves in illusion to pass as other similarly shaped creatures. Such genies can innately cast the disguise self spell at will, often with a longer duration than is normal for that spell. Mightier genies can cast the true polymorph spell one to three times per day, possibly with a longer duration than normal. Such genies can change only their own shape, but a rare few can use the spell on other creatures and objects as well.</text>
			<text>	Wishes.</text>
			<text>	The genie power to grant wishes is legendary among mortals. Only the most potent genies, such as those among the nobility, can do so. A particular genie that has this power can grant one to three wishes to a creature that isn't a genie. Once a genie has granted its limit of wishes, it can't grant wishes again for some amount of time (usually 1 year). and cosmic law dictates that the same genie can expend its limit of wishes on a specific creature only once in that creature's existence.</text>
			<text>	To be granted a wish, a creature within 60 feet of the genie states a desired effect to it. The genie can then cast the wish spell on the creature's behalf to bring about the effect. Depending on the genie's nature, the genie might try to pervert the intent of the wish by exploiting the wish's poor wording. The perversion of the wording is usually crafted to be to the genie's benefit.</text>

			<name>Petrifying Gaze</name>
			<text>When a creature that can see the medusa's eyes starts its turn within 30 ft. of the medusa, the medusa can force it to make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw if the medusa isn't incapacitated and can see the creature. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature is instantly petrified. Otherwise, a creature that fails the save begins to turn to stone and is restrained. The restrained creature must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn, becoming petrified on a failure or ending the effect on a success. The petrification lasts until the creature is freed by the greater restoration spell or other magic.</text>
			<text>	Unless surprised, a creature can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If the creature does so, it can't see the medusa until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If the creature looks at the medusa in the meantime, it must immediately make the save.</text>
			<text>	If the medusa sees itself reflected on a polished surface within 30 ft. of it and in an area of bright light, the medusa is, due to its curse, affected by its own gaze.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>Petrified:</text>

			<name>Night Hag Items</name>
			<text>A night hag carries two very rare magic items that she must craft for herself If either object is lost, the night hag will go to great lengths to retrieve it, as creating a new tool takes time and effort.</text>
			<text>	Heartstone: This lustrous black gem allows a night hag to become ethereal while it is in her possession. The touch of a heartstone also cures any disease. Crafting a heartstone takes 30 days. </text>
			<text>	Soul Bag: When an evil humanoid dies as a result of a night hag's Nightmare Haunting, the hag catches the soul in this black sack made of stitched flesh. A soul bag can hold only one evil soul at a time, and only the night hag who crafted the bag can catch a soul with it. Crafting a soul bag takes 7 days and a humanoid sacrifice (whose flesh is used to make the bag).</text>

			<name>Hag Coven</name>
			<text>When hags must work together, they form covens, in spite of their selfish natures. A coven is made up of hags of any type, all of whom are equals within the group. However, each of the hags continues to desire more personal power.</text>
			<text>	A coven consists of three hags so that any arguments between two hags can be settled by the third. If more than three hags ever come together, as might happen if two covens come into conflict, the result is usually chaos.</text>
		</trait>
		<trait>
			<name>Shared Spellcasting (Coven Only)</name>
			<text>While all three members of a hag coven are within 30 feet of one another, they can each cast the following spells from the wizard's spell list but must share the spell slots among themselves: </text>
			<text/>
			<text>• 1st level (4 slots): identify, ray of sickness </text>
			<text/>
			<text>• 2nd level (3 slots): hold person, locate object </text>
			<text/>
			<text>• 3rd level (3 slots): bestow curse, counterspell, lightning bolt </text>
			<text/>
			<text>• 4th level (3 slots): phantasmal killer, polymorph </text>
			<text/>
			<text>• 5th level (2 slots): contact other plane, scrying </text>
			<text/>
			<text>• 6th level (1 slot): eyebite</text>
			<text/>
			<text>	For casting these spells, each hag is a 12th-level spellcaster that uses Intelligence as her spellcasting ability. The spell save DC is 12+the hag's Intelligence modifier, and the spell attack bonus is 4+the hag's Intelligence modifier.</text>
		</trait>
		<trait>
			<name>Hag Eye (Coven Only)</name>
			<text>A hag coven can craft a magic item called a hag eye, which is made from a real eye coated in varnish and often fitted to a pendant or other wearable item. The hag eye is usually entrusted to a minion for safekeeping and transport. A hag in the coven can take an action to see what the hag eye sees if the hag eye is on the same plane of existence. A hag eye has AC 10, 1 hit point, and darkvision with a radius of 60 feet. If it is destroyed, each coven member takes 3d10 psychic damage and is blinded for 24 hours.</text>
			<text>	A hag coven can have only one hag eye at a time, and creating a new one requires all three members of the coven to perform a ritual. The ritual takes 1 hour, and the hags can't perform it while blinded. During the ritual, if the hags take any action other than performing the ritual, they must start over.</text>

If this effect reduces the target's hit point maximum to 0, the target dies, and if the target was evil, its soul is trapped in the hag's soul bag. The reduction to the target's hit point maximum lasts until removed by the greater restoration spell or similar magic.</text>

			<name>Shared Spellcasting (Coven Only)</name>
			<text>While all three members of a hag coven are within 30 feet of one another, they can each cast the following spells from the wizard's spell list but must share the spell slots among themselves: </text>

			<text/>
			<text>• 2nd level (3 slots): hold person, locate object </text>

		<trait>
			<name>Hag Eye (Coven Only)</name>
			<text>A hag coven can craft a magic item called a hag eye, which is made from a real eye coated in varnish and often fitted to a pendant or other wearable item. The hag eye is usually entrusted to a minion for safekeeping and transport. A hag in the coven can take an action to see what the hag eye sees if the hag eye is on the same plane of existence. A hag eye has AC 10, 1 hit point, and darkvision with a radius of 60 feet. If it is destroyed, each coven member takes 3d10 psychic damage and is blinded for 24 hours.</text>
			<text>	A hag coven can have only one hag eye at a time, and creating a new one requires all three members of the coven to perform a ritual. The ritual takes 1 hour, and the hags can't perform it while blinded. During the ritual, if the hags take any action other than performing the ritual, they must start over.</text>

			<text>The spectator shoots up to two of the following magical eye rays at one or two creatures it can see within 90 ft. of it. It can use each ray only once on a turn.</text>
			<text>	1. Confusion Ray. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw, or it can't take reactions until the end of its next turn. On its turn, the target can't move, and it uses its action to make a melee or ranged attack against a randomly determined creature within range. If the target can't attack, it does nothing on its turn.</text>
			<text>	2. Paralyzing Ray. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</text>
			<text>	3. Fear Ray. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, with disadvantage if the spectator is visible to the target, ending the effect on itself on a success.</text>

		<trait>
			<name>Shapechanger</name>
			<text>If the vampire isn't in sun light or running water, it can use its action to polymorph into a Tiny bat or a Medium cloud of mist, or back into its true form.</text>
			<text>	While in bat form, the vampire can't speak, its walking speed is 5 feet, and it has a flying speed of 30 feet. Its statistics, other than its size and speed, are unchanged. Anything it is wearing transforms with it, but nothing it is carrying does. It reverts to its true form if it dies.</text>
			<text>	While in mist form, the vampire can't take any actions, speak, or manipulate objects. It is weightless, has a flying speed of 20 feet, can hover, and can enter a hostile creature's space and stop there. In addition, if air can pass through a space, the mist can do so without squeezing, and it can't pass through water. It has advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws, and it is immune to all nonmagical damage, except the damage it takes from sunlight.</text>
		</trait>
		<trait>
			<name>Legendary Resistance (3/Day)</name>
			<text>If the vampire fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.</text>
		</trait>
		<trait>
			<name>Misty Escape</name>
			<text>When it drops to 0 hit points outside its resting place, the vampire transforms into a cloud of mist (as in the Shapechanger trait) instead of falling unconscious, provided that it isn't in sunlight or running water. If it can't transform, it is destroyed.</text>
			<text>	While it has 0 hit points in mist form, it can't revert to its vampire form, and it must reach its resting place within 2 hours or be destroyed. Once in its resting place, it reverts to its vampire form. It is then paralyzed until it regains at least 1 hit point. After spending 1 hour in its resting place with 0 hit points, it regains 1 hit point.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>Paralyzed:</text>
			<text>• A paralyzed creature is incapacitated, meaning it can't take actions or reactions, and can't move or speak.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>• The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>• Any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature.</text>
		</trait>
		<trait>
			<name>Regeneration</name>
			<text>The vampire regains 20 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point and isn't in sunlight or running water. If the vampire takes radiant damage or damage from holy water, this trait doesn't function at the start of the vampire's next turn.</text>
		</trait>
		<trait>
			<name>Spider Climb</name>
			<text>The vampire can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.</text>
		</trait>
		<trait>
			<name>Vampire Weaknesses</name>
			<text>The vampire has the following flaws. </text>
			<text>	Forbiddance: The vampire can't enter a residence without an invitation from one of the occupants.</text>
			<text>	Harmed by Running Water: The vampire takes 20 acid damage if it ends its turn in running water.</text>
			<text>	Stake to the Heart: If a piercing weapon made of wood is driven into the vampire's heart while the vampire is incapacitated in its resting place, the vampire is paralyzed until the stake is removed.</text>
			<text>	Sunlight Hypersensitivity: The vampire takes 20 radiant damage when it starts its turn in sunlight. While in sunlight, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>Paralyzed:</text>
			<text>• A paralyzed creature is incapacitated, meaning it can't take actions or reactions, and can't move or speak.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>• The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.</text>
			<text/>

		<action>
			<name>Bite (Bat or Vampire Form Only)</name>
			<text>Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one willing creature, or a creature that is grappled by the vampire, incapacitated, or restrained. Hit: 7 (1d6+4) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) necrotic damage. The target's hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken, and the vampire regains hit points equal to that amount. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0. A humanoid slain in this way and then buried in the ground rises the following night as a vampire spawn under the vampire's control.</text>
			<attack>|9|1d6+4+3d6</attack>
		</action>
		<action>
			<name>Charm</name>
			<text>The vampire targets one humanoid it can see within 30 ft. of it. If the target can see the vampire, the target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw against this magic or be charmed by the vampire. The charmed target regards the vampire as a trusted friend to be heeded and protected. Although the target isn't under the vampire's control, it takes the vampire's requests or actions in the most favorable way it can, and it is a willing target for the vampire's bit attack.</text>
			<text>	Each time the vampire or the vampire's companions do anything harmful to the target, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. Otherwise, the effect lasts 24 hours or until the vampire is destroyed, is on a different plane of existence than the target, or takes a bonus action to end the effect.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>Charmed:</text>
			<text>• A charmed creature can't attack the charmer or target the charmer with harmful abilities or magical effects.</text>

			<text>The yochlol transforms into toxic mist or reverts to its true form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying is also transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies.</text>
			<text>	While in mist form, the yochlol is incapacitated and can't speak. It has a flying speed of 30 feet, can hover, and can pass through any space that isn't airtight. It has advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws, and it is immune to nonmagical damage.</text>
			<text>	While in mist form, the yochlol can enter a creature's space and stop there. Each time that creature starts its turn with the yochlol in its space, the creature must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the start of its next turn. While poisoned in this way, the target is incapacitated.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>Incapacitated:</text>
			<text>• An incapacitated creature can't take actions or reactions.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>Poisoned:</text>
			<text>• A poisoned creature has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.</text>
		</action>
		<action>
			<name>Variant: Summon Demon (1/Day)</name>
			<text>The demon chooses what to summon and attempts a magical summoning.</text>
			<text>	A yochlol has a 50 percent chance of summoning one yochlol.</text>
			<text>	A summoned demon appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of its summoner, acts as an ally of its summoner, and can't summon other demons. It remains for 1 minute, until it or its summoner dies, or until its summoner dismisses it as an action.</text>

The oblex can impersonate 1d4 + 1 different creatures, each one tethered to its body by a strand of slime that can extend up to 120 feet away. For all practical purposes, the simulacrum is the oblex, meaning that the oblex occupies its space and the simulacrum's space simultaneously.

Constructs, oozes, plants, and undead succeed on the save automatically.</text>
			<text>    While memory drained, the target must roll a d4 and subtract the number rolled from any ability check or attack roll it makes. Each time the target is memory drained beyond the first, the die size increases by one: the d4 becomes a d6, the d6 becomes a d8, and so on until the die becomes a d20, at which point the target becomes unconscious for 1 hour. The effect then ends.</text>

			<name>Spectral Duplicate (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest)</name>
			<text>As a bonus action, the berbalang creates one spectral duplicate of itself in an unoccupied space it can see within 60 feet of it. While the duplicate exists, the berbalang is unconscious. A berbalang can have only one duplicate at a time. The duplicate disappears when it or the berbalang drops to 0 hit points or when the berbalang dismisses it (no action required). The duplicate has the same statistics and knowledge as the berbalang, and everything experienced by the duplicate is known by the berbalang. All damage dealt by the duplicate's attacks is psychic damage.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>Unconscious:</text>
			<text>• An unconscious creature is incapacitated, meaning it can't take actions or reactions, can't move or speak, and is unaware of its surroundings.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>• The creature drops whatever it's holding and falls prone.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>• The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.</text>

		<trait>
			<name>Individual Designs</name>
			<text>A gnome artisan values an individualized clockwork more highly than a perfectly functioning one that copies too much from another creation. For that reason, even clockworks that fit established designs, such as those described here, are seldom identical.</text>
			<text>    A clockwork can be customized by adding one of the following enhancements and one potential malfunction to its stat block. You can select randomly or choose a pair of modifications that fit the temperament of the clockwork's builder.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>d10 — Enhancement:</text>
			<text/>
			<text>1 — Camouflaged. The clockwork gains proficiency in Stealth if it doesn't already have it. While motionless, it is indistinguishable from a stopped machine.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>2 — Sensors. The range of the clockwork's darkvision becomes 120 feet, unless it is higher, and it gains proficiency in Perception if it doesn't already have it.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>3 — Improved Armor. The clockwork's AC increases by 2.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>4 — Increased Speed. The clockwork's speed increases by 10 feet.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>5 — Reinforced Construction. The clockwork has resistance to force, lightning, and thunder damage.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>6 — Self-Repairing. If the clockwork starts its turn with at least 1 hit point, it regains 5 hit points. If it takes lightning damage, this ability doesn't function at the start of its next turn.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>7 — Sturdy Frame. The clockwork's hit point maximum increases by an amount equal to its number of Hit Dice.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>8 — Suction. The clockwork gains a climbing speed of 30 feet.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>9 — Vocal Resonator. The clockwork gains the ability to speak rudimentary Common or Gnomish (creator's choice).</text>
			<text/>
			<text>10 — Water Propulsion. The clockwork gains a swimming speed of 30 feet.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>Clockwork Malfunctions:</text>
			<text/>
			<text>d10 — Malfunction</text>
			<text/>
			<text>1 — Faulty Sensors. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork is blinded until the end of its turn.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>2 — Flawed Targeting. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork makes attack rolls with disadvantage until the end of its turn.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>3 — Ground Fault. The clockwork has vulnerability to lightning damage.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>4 — Imprinting Loop. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork mistakes one creature it can see within 30 feet for its creator. The clockwork won't willingly harm that creature for 1 minute or until that creature attacks it or deals damage to it.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>5 — Leaking Lubricant. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork gains 1 level of exhaustion that it isn't immune to.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>6 — Limited Steering. The clockwork must move in a straight line. It can turn up to 90 degrees before moving and again at the midpoint of its movement. It can rotate freely if it doesn't use any of its speeds on its turn.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>7 — Overactive Sense of Self-Preservation. If the clockwork has half its hit points or fewer at the start of its turn in combat, roll a d6. If you roll a 1, it retreats from combat. If retreat isn't possible, it continues fighting.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>8 — Overheats. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork is incapacitated until the end of its turn.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>9 — Rusty Gears. The clockwork has disadvantage on initiative rolls, and its speed decreases by 10 feet.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>10 — Weak Armor. The clockwork isn't immune to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks that aren't adamantine.</text>

			<name>Tentacle</name>
			<text>Melee Weapon Attack: +17 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 35 (4d12+9) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 23 Constitution saving throw or its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if its hit point maximum is reduced to 0.</text>
			<attack>Tentacle|17|4d6+10</attack>
		</action>
		<action>
			<name>Gaze</name>
			<text>Demogorgon turns his magical gaze toward one creature that he can see within 120 feet of him. That target must make a DC 23 Wisdom saving throw. Unless the target is incapacitated, it can avert its eyes to avoid the gaze and to automatically succeed on the save. If the target does so, it can't see Demogorgon until the start of his next turn. If the target looks at him in the meantime, it must immediately make the save.</text>
			<text>    If the target fails the save, the target suffers one of the following effects of Demogorgon's choice or at random:</text>
			<text>    1. Beguiling Gaze: The target is stunned until the start of Demogorgon's next turn or until Demogorgon is no longer within line of sight.</text>
			<text>    2. Hypnotic Gaze: The target is charmed by Demogorgon until the start of Demogorgon's next turn. Demogorgon chooses how the charmed target uses its actions, reactions, and movement. Because this gaze requires Demogorgon to focus both heads on the target, he can't use his Maddening Gaze legendary action until the start of his next turn.</text>
			<text>    3. Insanity Gaze: The target suffers the effect of the confusion spell without making a saving throw. The effect lasts until the start of Demogorgon's next turn. Demogorgon doesn't need to concentrate on the spell.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>Charmed:</text>
			<text>• A charmed creature can't attack the charmer or target the charmer with harmful abilities or magical effects.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>• The charmer has advantage on any ability check to interact socially with the creature.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>Stunned:</text>
			<text>• A stunned creature is incapacitated, meaning it can't take actions or reactions, can't move, and can speak only falteringly.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>• The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.</text>
		</action>
		<action>
			<name>Lair Actions</name>
			<text>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Demogorgon can take a lair action to cause one of the following effects; he can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row: </text>
			<text/>
			<text>• Demogorgon creates an illusory duplicate of himself, which appears in his own space and lasts until initiative count 20 of the next round. On his turn, Demogorgon can move the illusory duplicate a distance equal to his walking speed (no action required). The first time a creature or object interacts physically with Demogorgon (for example, by hitting him with an attack), there is a 50 percent chance that the illusory duplicate is being affected, not Demogorgon himself, in which case the illusion disappears. </text>
			<text/>
			<text>• Demogorgon casts the darkness spell four times at its lowest level, targeting different areas with the spell. Demogorgon doesn’t need to concentrate on the spells, which end on initiative count 20 of the next round.</text>
